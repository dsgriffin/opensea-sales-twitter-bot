# OpenSea Sales Twitter Bot

A (quickly put together) bot that monitors Opensea sales for a given collection & then posts them to Twitter.

## Donations

If you find this script/repo useful for your project, any ETH/Altcoin/NFT donations are greatly appreciated üôè

Eth Address: 0xDCA88f66CEc8972D23DE7d5e69c40E087C92132f

## Requirements

- [Twitter Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)

- A OpenSea API Key (request one [here](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-overview))

- Heroku Account (a free account **should** be fine **if** you tweak the project to run less often than every minute (by default it is every minute), otherwise a $7 a month dyno instance is more than enough).

## Setup

- Clone/Fork/Copy this project to your local public/private git repo

- Create a Twitter Developer App (make sure you change it to have both read/write permissions)

- Create a new Heroku app & set it as a remote branch of your git repo (see [Heroku Remote](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#creating-a-heroku-remote))

- Make sure you are logged in to the Twitter account you want the bot to run on (as the next step will be authorizing the bot to post on your account)

- Install [Twurl](https://github.com/twitter/twurl) and, using your Twitter Developer consumer key & secret, generate the access token & access secret

In the Settings section of your Heroku app you'll see a Config Vars section. Add the following config vars:

- **CONSUMER_KEY** - Your Twitter Developer App's Consumer Key
- **CONSUMER_SECRET** - Your Twitter Developer App's Consumer Secret
- **ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY** - The Access Token Key of the Twitter Account your bot is posting from
- **ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET** - The Access Token Secret of the Twitter Account your bot is posting from
- **OPENSEA_COLLECTION_SLUG** - The OpenSea collection name you wish to track (e.g. `cryptopunks`)
- **X_API_KEY** - Your unique OpenSea API key

Now you're ready to release - just push up the code via. git to the Heroku remote (see [Heroku Remote](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#creating-a-heroku-remote) if unsure how).

Make sure you are using `worker` dynos and not `web` dynos - you can set this in the CLI your project with:

```sh
heroku ps:scale web=0
heroku ps:scale worker=1
```

## Modification

By default I am just include the name, price in eth & usd, a hashtag or two and a link to the NFT on OpenSea. Check out the [OpenSea Events API](https://docs.opensea.io/reference#retrieving-asset-events) if you want to include additional info (such as seller/buyer addresses etc.).

There is `tweetWithImage` function that you can use instead of the default `tweet` method if you prefer - this will display the full image file as part of the tweet, instead of the standard OpenSea preview image.

In `app.js`, on line 24 you can see there's a commented out conditional if you'd like to only tweet out sales above a certain amount of Eth.

As mentioned at the top of the README, it runs every 60 seconds by default - you can change this to run less often if you'd like to keep it on a free Heroku instance.
